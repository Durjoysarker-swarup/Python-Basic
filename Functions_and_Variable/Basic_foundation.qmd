# Taking the input from user
```{python}
#| tags: [parameters]
Name = "_"
print(f"Welcome, {Name}")
```

# Comments
```{python}
# this is a comment --> these are the psudocode
"""So this is also a comment"""
```

# Adding the "" in the print function output
```{python}
print('hello "Swarup"')
```

# Format 
f"" -> this is used for the formating the print function and it is very useful and easy.
```{python}
Name=Name.title().strip()
print(f"hello, {Name}")
```

# Most effective way
name= input("what's your name? ").strip().title()
print(f"hello, {name}")

#split the first name and the last name
first,last= name.split(" ")
print(f"hello, {first}")

#creating the simple input to calculate
x = int(input("what's is x? "))                        
y = int(input("what's is y? "))
print(x+y)

#round(number[, ndigits])
x = float(input("what's is x? "))
y = float(input("what's is y? "))
z = round(x/y, 2)
print(z)
#just for the more formatting
z = x/y
print(f"{z:.2f}")
